# Postmortem: Outage on XYZ Web Service

## Issue Summary

**Duration:**  
- **Start:** May 10, 2024, 09:00 AM (UTC)  
- **End:** May 10, 2024, 11:30 AM (UTC)  

**Impact:**  
- The XYZ web service was completely down.
- Users experienced an inability to access the service, with 100% of users affected during this period.
- This resulted in significant downtime for businesses relying on our platform.

**Root Cause:**  
- A misconfigured database replication setting caused a cascade failure, leading to the database becoming read-only.

## Timeline

- **09:00 AM:** Issue detected by monitoring alerts indicating high error rates on the web service.
- **09:05 AM:** Engineers on-call verified the issue and began investigation.
- **09:10 AM:** Initial assumption was a network failure; network team was engaged.
- **09:25 AM:** Network checks returned normal; focus shifted to application servers.
- **09:40 AM:** Logs indicated repeated database connection failures.
- **09:50 AM:** Database team was alerted; initial inspection pointed to replication lag.
- **10:10 AM:** Misleading path: Attempted to restart database nodes, which did not resolve the issue.
- **10:30 AM:** Further analysis revealed the database was in read-only mode due to misconfigured replication settings.
- **10:50 AM:** Configuration was corrected, and the database returned to normal operation.
- **11:10 AM:** Web service began to recover, monitored closely for stability.
- **11:30 AM:** Issue fully resolved; services confirmed back to normal.

## Root Cause and Resolution

**Root Cause:**  
- The primary database was configured with incorrect replication settings during a routine update. 
- This led to the secondary database promoting itself to primary, causing the actual primary database to switch to read-only mode. 
- As a result, the web service could not perform write operations, leading to the outage.

**Resolution:**  
- The database team identified the misconfiguration and corrected the replication settings. 
- This allowed the primary database to resume normal operations. 
- The database nodes were then synchronized correctly, and normal service was restored.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures

**Improvements:**  
1. **Enhanced Monitoring:** Implement detailed monitoring for database replication statuses.
2. **Configuration Management:** Review and enhance the database configuration change process to prevent similar issues.
3. **Automated Testing:** Develop automated tests for replication configurations to catch errors before deployment.
4. **Documentation:** Update the incident response documentation to include database replication scenarios.

**Tasks:**  
- [ ] Patch database server to the latest version.
- [ ] Add monitoring alerts for replication lag and read-only status.
- [ ] Implement automated replication configuration tests.
- [ ] Conduct a training session for engineers on database failover procedures.
- [ ] Review and update change management processes to include additional checks for critical configurations.

## Humorous Note

> Our database had a little identity crisis and decided it was time for a vacation. We've since convinced it to stick to its day job.
